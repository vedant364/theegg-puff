Most people still think buying crypto is rocket science — but I started with ₹5,000 and a phone.

Here’s exactly how I bought and stored my first crypto — the *same way I’d teach an absolute beginner today*:

1. **Create an account on PayOnRamp.**  
   I chose PayOnRamp because they charged me only ₹45–50 on a ₹5,000 deposit — one of the cheapest I found. Link your bank account and verify as required.

2. **Create a Rabby Wallet (hot wallet for EVM chains).**  
   Rabby helps you store crypto across EVM chains and is phone-friendly.  
   **Important:** Back up your seed phrase on paper and keep it safe. If you lose it, even the wallet company cannot recover your funds. ⚠️

3. **Buy USDT (Polygon) and send to your Rabby address.**  
   In PayOnRamp, go to Buy/Sell → enter the INR amount → choose **USDT (Polygon)** → paste your Rabby wallet address → double-check the address and confirm.

Voila — you just bought and stored crypto. Congrats — welcome to the top 1% of people who actually started.

**Notes & cautions**
- Start only with an amount you’re comfortable losing. This is educational — not financial advice.  
- For long-term storage, prefer **cold wallets** (hardware wallets) over hot wallets like Rabby.  
- There are other ways to buy; I’m sharing the exact steps I followed as a beginner. DMs are open for questions and feedback.

Arigatou ✌️
